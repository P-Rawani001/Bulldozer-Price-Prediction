# ðŸšœ Bulldozer Price Prediction  

Predicting the sale price of bulldozers using **Machine Learning**.  
This project is inspired by the **Blue Book for Bulldozers** Kaggle dataset and demonstrates how to apply regression models for real-world price forecasting.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
Bulldozers are commonly bought and sold at auctions, and their prices depend on many factors such as:  
- **Model year**  
- **Usage hours**  
- **Product group**  
- **Enclosure type**  
- **Engine details**  

In this project, we:  
- Preprocess the raw auction dataset  
- Perform **feature engineering**  
- Train ML models (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost)  
- Evaluate using metrics such as **RMSLE (Root Mean Squared Log Error)**
